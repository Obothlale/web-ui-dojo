# Clarity


A web app shouldn't have to come with an instruction manual.

# Clarity - Example 

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/5. Clarity/index.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# Clarity - Observations

* The images were blurry!
* Tonnes of buttons with icons but no text
    * OST Stop loss trigger.
    * Disco's red chilly pepper.

# Clarity - Analysis

* Make sure even the most in-experienced user will know what actions do (Don't assume the user will know what it does)
* Make sure actions and instructions are clear, the flow of a page could also affect this greatly
* Placeholders should not be the hints or labels for inputs
