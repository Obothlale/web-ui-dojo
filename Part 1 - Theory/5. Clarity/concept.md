# Clarity - Analysis
* Make sure even the most in-experienced user will know what actions do (Don't assume the user will know what it does)
* Make sure actions and instructions are clear, the flow of a page could also affect this greatly
* Placeholders should not be the hints or labels for inputs

## Bad things to point out
* Blurry images
* Buttons with icons and no text
    * Stand OST Stop loss trigger. Icons.
    * Disco's red chilly pepper example.
