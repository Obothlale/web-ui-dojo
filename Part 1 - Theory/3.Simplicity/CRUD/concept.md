# CRUD Screens

Whats better? 
Doing Crud in isolation or on the same list page ?

# CRUD - Example 

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/CRUD/index.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# CRUD - Analysis
* Where is best to do updates, created, deletes, edit or other actions (same page vs isloation)
* Modals and sub panel still count as being on the same page.

## things to point out
* Each has its pros and cons
