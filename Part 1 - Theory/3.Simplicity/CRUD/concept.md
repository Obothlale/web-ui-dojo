# CRUD Screens

Just incase you've never heard of CRUD - **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete

This is probably the second most common kind of feature we build on a day-to-day basis

# CRUD - Example

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/CRUD/indexPart1.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>

# CRUD - Observations 

* The layout choices that may be suitable for headline of promotional products sales, may not be suitable for product catalogues or product management.
* A shopping cart isn't the right icon for ordering stock!?

# CRUD - Example

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/CRUD/indexPart2.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# CRUD - Observations 

* Our buttons don't have any description of what they do.
* Our list of products still lacks context
    * i.e. what is a user meant to be doing with this screen?

# CRUD - Example

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/CRUD/indexPart3.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# CRUD - Analysis
* Where is it best to do CRUD operations?
    * Inline editing?
    * Same page? (modals, side bars, sub panel etc.)
        * Do modals and sub panel still count as being on the same page?
    * Different pages?
        * Does it make sense to have a dedicated pages for each CRUD operation?
