# Less is More - Analysis

* Managing the users attention is key, so a page should not bea too busy (people look from left to right (vs asia right to left)
* Button placement should a submit button go on the left or on the right? Does it matter?
* Button colours (A green delete button would be cause for concern)

## Bad things to point out

* There is to much going on the background drowns out the actual product
* Button placement is inconsistant 
* Button Colour does not suite the action
