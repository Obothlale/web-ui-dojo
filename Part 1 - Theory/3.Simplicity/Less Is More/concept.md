# Less is More

The following example is not much of an exaggeration of what grads produce in Entelct bootcamps. :)

# Less is More - Example 

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/Less is More/index.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# Less is More - Observations

* This is chaos!
* The background drowns out the actual products

# Less is More - Example 

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/Less is More/indexPart1.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# Less is More - Observations

* Button placement is inconsistent 
* Image sizing is inconsistent
* Alignment is very poor

# Less is More - Example 

<iframe src="./Part 1 - Theory/3.Simplicity/Less is More/indexPart2.html" style="width: 100%; height: 80vh;"/>  

# Less is More - Observations

* Button Colour does not suite the action.
* Button sizing is hampering the eye tracking on the page, making it harder to scan the products.
* Button placement is taking precedence over the product, taking user attention away from the product.
    * Where should it go? Does it really matter?
* Without a background, it's looking a little bland now.

# Less is More - Analysis

* Managing the users attention is key, so a page should not be too busy 
* Be aware of eye tracking:
    * Western cultures look from left to right
    * Eastern cultures look from right to left
    * How would this affect the page layout?
* Expectations of your UI:
    * Your choices in button colours and iconography can set expectations of the actions
    * But you also need to be aware of the expectations of the rest of the internet around these conventions.
        * e.g. A green delete button would be cause for concern
