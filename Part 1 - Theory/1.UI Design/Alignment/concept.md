# Alignment - Analysis

* Alignment - arrangement in a straight line or in correct relative positions
* The way elements are positioned on a page is really important (Page Layout)
* The Layout of elements should guide the flow of actions to be performed on a page
* Alignment of elements won't get praise, but when elements are not aligned your site will be criticized

## Bad things to point out

* The submit button is floating around in the middle
* The form controls are inconsistently laid out in terms of their vertical alignment
* Inconsistent sizing of form controls
* The input boxes are inconsistent sizes 
* The remember me checkbox has to be counter styled now (against the css framework) to get it to align to something.
