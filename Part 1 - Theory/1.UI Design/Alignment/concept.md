# Alignment

* Elements of our pages need to line up. 
* Even being a few pixels off can be jarring to a user.
* Often a user won't even be able to articulate that the alignment is off, but they'll feel that the page is messy.

# Alignment - Bad to Better

# Alignment - Observations

* The submit button is floating around in the middle
* The form controls are inconsistently laid out in terms of their vertical alignment
* Inconsistent sizing of form controls
* The input boxes are inconsistent sizes 
* The "remember me" checkbox has to be counter styled now (against the css framework) to get it to align to something.

# Alignment - Better to Good

# Alignment - Analysis

* Use your css framework's grid system! This will make arrangement of elements in straight lines or in correct relative positions easier
* The way elements are positioned on a page is really important
* The layout of elements should guide the flow of actions to be performed on a page (eye tracking)
* Alignment of elements won't get praise, but when elements are not aligned your site will be criticized
