# Navigations

"When it comes to websites, the navigation system acts like a road map to all the different areas and information contained within the website." ~ Andrea Gust

# Navigations - Observations

* The branding doesn't take us back to the home page
* Theres no "active" indicator to remind us where we are
* Doesn't have any form of UI hints as to where you came from. Typically your breadcrumbs would provide these hints. 

# Navigations - Analysis

* This is the gateway to all the functionality within the system, it needs to be intuitive.
* Navigations can also be platform specific:
    * Think about how different a mobile side navigation menu is from a traditional desktop top navigation menu.
    * Think about how gestures are a primary form of input for navigation on mobile, but non-existent on traditional desktops.
