# Navigations - Analysis

* "When it comes to websites, the navigation system acts like a road map to all the different areas and information contained within the website." ~ Andrea Gust
* This is the gateway to all the functionality within the system, It needs to be intuative.

## Bad things to point out

* The branding doesn't take us back to the home page
* Theres no active indicator
* Doesn't have any form of UI hints as to where you came from. Typically your breadcrumbs would provide these hints.
