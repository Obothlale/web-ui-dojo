# Bigger click areas - Analysis

* This is an area of UI design that is often overlooked
* Nothing is worse than trying multiple time to click on a "Remember Me" checkbox that just can't be clicked
* A user can lose out on the full functionality of a site, especially if information hiding UI techniques are used, as they won't know that things are clickable.
