# Bigger click areas - Analysis
* This is an area of UI design that is often overlooked
* Nothing is worse than trying multiple time to click on a "Remember Me" checkbox that just cant be clicked
* A user can loose out on the full functionality of a site, especially if the site has hidden elements, that can't be reached because of tiny click areas 

## Bad things to point out

* The Collapsable panel can only be opened by clicking on the caret, this is a tiny click area
* The Radio buttons can only be selected by clicking on the button area
* The checkbox can only be seleted by clicking onthe box itself
* Cursor does not change when hovering over clickable areas
