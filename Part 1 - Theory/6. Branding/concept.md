# Branding - Analysis
* Giving the website your business identity
* Using Colour - Business colours  (if these are bad, stick to a basic monochomatic themes)
* Using Fonts - Fonts are a great way to reach your target audience and make them feel comfortable (No ariel or Times New Roman)
* Images - Careful use of high resolution images is essential, a picture says a 1000 words (dont use to many or to little) (Blog VS Corporate site)
