# Thoughts
* Do you need to handle every single error
* Anti-patter of moving items up or down in a list (Possible example)
* Borders are like a fashion accessory
* Zero Data - Maybe explore this theme some more (Material Design)

* Be subtle but not silent (FFeedback instead of silence)



* UI Design is like fashion, it changes as time goes on
